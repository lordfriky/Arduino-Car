## _¿What really is **Arduino-Car**?_
This was my first project, but it isn't really mine, this is just a copy of TheTeacherG's remote control Arduino car. (You can find it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dsjw7u619affgaf/Carro%20Sensor%20de%20Distancia%20Bluetooth.txt?dl=0)).
More than the modified app, the thing that we presented was an idea of safe transportation.
## _The idea_
When we create Arduino-Car we think about those people that, for some reason, couldn't drive a conventional car, so we want to make an alternative that even an 8 years old children could drive. From that the idea of building _Arduino-Car_ was born.
## _The development_
## _Make your own one_
The needed material isn't too difficult to get. The needs an HC-05 or similar (as HC-06 or even HM-10 to get iOS compatibility) for Android comunication, an L293D driver for motor controlling and a HC-SR04 for safety purposes. You can find an image of the connections above here or using the .fzz file on Fritzing
