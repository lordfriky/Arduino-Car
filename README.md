## Make your own one
The material you need is not too difficult to get. You will need an HC-05 or similar (as HC-06 or even HM-10 to get iOS compatibility) for app comunication, an L293D driver for motor-controlling and a HC-SR04 for safety purposes. You can find an image of the connections below or using the .fzz file on Fritzing. The image was made assuming that the HC-SR04 distance sensor goes in front of the car.

To set up the Arduino board you just have to charge the code provided (the .ino file) with Arduino IDE before connecting everything else, nothing more. If you don't have it you can get it from the [Arduino page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

If you want to modify the app or just to get to know how it works you just have to import the .aia file to your MIT AppInventor account. Feel free to make any modification you want!

## Special Thanks
